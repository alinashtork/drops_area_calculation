# drops_area_calculation
Here I present the code for processing microscopy photos of almost round drops (can be used for proccesing cells images). I used methods of OpenCV based on thresholding for the task of image segmentation. During segmentation, objects with blurred bounds are not selected, then contours of the objects were found and objects areas were calculated. Also, I calculate circularity for the sake of excluding non-target objects (glares, garbage, etc).
